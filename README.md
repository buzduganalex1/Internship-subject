# Fizzbuzz
- Create a new solution in visual studio
- Add a new C# project with an appropriate name to the solution
- Add a new class and add a new function with appropriate name
- The function takes as input a string that represents a number and outputs return string.
- The function must print the following to the command window:
  - if the number is divisible by 3 then print “fizz”
  - if the number is divisible by 5 then print “buzz”
  - if the number is divisible by both 5 and 3 then print “fizzbuzz”
- otherwise just print the number itself
- Create a new test project with an appropriate name
- Add a test class with several test methods that validate your implementation for the created function.
